sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Has almost the same worst-case scenario time complexity as Selection Sort - O(n^2), but has a better best-case scenario time complexity - Ω(n), and ran in less time than Selection Sort when run with sorted50000.txt.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It has the best time complexity of the 3 possible sorts in the worst-case scenario - O(n logn) and takes the least amount of time to run with reversed50000.txt.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Is very slightly faster than Bubble Sort in worst-case scenario, but also takes longer than Bubble Sort in the best-case scenario - Ω(n^2), so it took the longest time to run with reversed50000.txt.
